 <h1>Software</h1>
 <p>Software is a set of programs and instructions that tell a computer, 
    phone, or tablet what to do. It is not a physical object, so you cannot 
    touch it, but you use it every day. Examples of software are mobile apps, 
    websites, games, and operating systems like Windows, Android, and iOS.</p>

     <h1>Hardware</h1>
 <p>Hardware is the physical part of a computer or electronic device. It is everything you can see and touch. 
    Examples of hardware include the keyboard, mouse, screen, processor, memory, and hard drive. Without hardware, a computer cannot exist.
Hardware works together with software. While software gives instructions, hardware executes 
those instructions. For example, when you open a program, the processor processes the data, 
the memory stores information, and the screen shows the result.
Internal hardware, such as the CPU, RAM, and storage, is responsible for the performance of the device.</p>

    <h1>Logic</h1>
 <p>Logic is the ability to think clearly, analyze situations, and make correct decisions 
    based on rules and reasoning. In technology, logic is used to solve problems step by step 
    and to decide what action should happen next.</p>

      <h1>Database</h1>
 <p>A database is an organized place where data is stored, managed, and retrieved. 
    It is used to keep information in a structured way so it can be easily found, updated, 
    and deleted. Databases are used in almost all software systems.</p>

      <h1>WCM</h1>
 <p>WCM stands for Web Content Management. It is a system used to create, edit, organize, 
    and publish content on websites. With a WCM, users can manage text, images, videos, 
    and pages through an easy interface, without needing advanced programming skills.</p>

      <h1>Mobile</h1>
 <p>Mobile refers to technology related to smartphones and tablets. Mobile devices are 
    portable and allow people to communicate, access the internet, use applications, and 
    perform daily tasks from anywhere. Examples of mobile devices include Android phones 
    and iPhones.</p>

      <h1>Information Security</h1>
 <p>Information security is the practice of protecting information from unauthorized access, 
    use, modification, or destruction. Its main goal is to keep data safe and reliable. 
    Information security is important for personal data, company information, and digital 
    systems.</p>
